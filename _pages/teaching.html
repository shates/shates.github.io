Before studying Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences at UW-Madison, I worked as an Outdoor Science Instructor in the San Bernardino Mountains in Southern California.

<b>Outreach</b>: <br>
I've been involved in a number of outreach activities with students in elementary, middle and high school. With the ability meet virtually on applications like zoom, I've met different groups and classrooms through Skype a Scientist and the Cooperative Institute for Meteorlogical Satellite Studies (CIMSS) virtual WX workshop.  With the CIMSS high school virtual WX workshop, I've led interactive workshops on snow storms, accessing climate/weather data online. The word cloud shows some interactive responses from high schoolers in my session.
