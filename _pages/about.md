I am an atmospheric scientist studying clouds and precipitation in the mid and high latitudes. I am especially interested in clouds and precipitation near the surface, which can be difficult to observe from space-based radars because of ground clutter. My research uses ground-based remote sensing observations from multi-instrument suites to study precipitation falling within this Satellite Radar Blind Zone. In this we work, we hope to address questions such as, *How is precipitation rate changing with height? What phase of precipitation is reaching the surface? Is there precipitation reaching the surface?*
