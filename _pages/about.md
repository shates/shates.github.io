From winter storms to deep convection, my work seeks to investigate cloud and precipitation processes using multi-instrument perspectives.  Currently, I am a JPL Postdoctoral Fellow in the <a href="https://science.jpl.nasa.gov/division/earth-science/atmospheric-physics-and-weather/">Atmospheric Physics and Weather Group</a>. For my research, I am exploring ice cloud properties in convective weather events from aircraft field campaign data including in-situ probe and radar remote sensing observations. In this study, we're using a forward model to test how microphysical assumptions about ice particle habit influence simulated reflectivities, which is important for informing retrieval development and data assimulation. This research is connected to satellite radar missions such as the INvestigation of Convective UpdraftS (**INCUS**), as well as future missions that will feature space-borne radars observing clouds, convection, and precipitation.

In my PhD research, I used ground-based and space-based observations to examine clouds and precipitation at mid and high-latitudes sites. While there are near-global observations of clouds and preciptiation from space-based remote sensing, ground clutter makes observations near the surface less reliable resulting in a *Satellite Radar Blind Zone*. My research was focused on using ground-based observations to characterize unique precipitation regimes and assess satellite detectability. Using snowfall events detected by ground-based radar, we collocated to CloudSat observations to expand from ground-based to include satellite-based perspectives. I was advised by
