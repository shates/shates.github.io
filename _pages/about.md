I am a JPL postdoctoral fellow working on ice cloud microphyics. I am especially interested in ice cloud properties such as particle habit and how different environments produce unique microphysics. To explore clouds in varying environments (including convective storms and winter snowfall), I use observations from air-craft field campaigns, which sampled cloud properties with collocated remote sensing observations.

In my PhD research, my research examined clouds and precipitation in the mid and high latitudes. Specifically, I focused on snowing clouds that can be difficult to observe from space-based radars because of ground clutter. My research uses ground-based remote sensing observations from multi-instrument suites to study precipitation falling within this ***Satellite Radar Blind Zone***. I was advised by
